# Obsidian AMaps

Adds a map layout to [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) using [AMap (高德地图)](https://lbs.amap.com/) API.

- Dynamically display markers that match your filters.
- Use marker icons and colors defined by properties.
- Support for standard, satellite, and hybrid map types.
- Optimized for users in China mainland.

## Project Overview

- Target: Obsidian Community Plugin (TypeScript → bundled JavaScript).
- Entry point: `main.ts` compiled to `main.js` and loaded by Obsidian.
- Required release artifacts: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optional `styles.css`.

## Environment & Tooling

- Node.js: use current LTS (Node 18+ recommended).
- **Package manager: npm** (required - `package.json` defines npm scripts and dependencies).
- **Bundler: esbuild** (required - `esbuild.config.mjs` and build scripts depend on it).
- Types: `obsidian` type definitions.

**Note**: This project depends on npm and esbuild. If you're creating a plugin from scratch, you can choose different tools, but you'll need to replace the build configuration accordingly.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Dev (watch)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## File & Folder Conventions

- **Organize code into multiple files**: Split functionality across separate modules rather than putting everything in `main.ts`.
- Source lives in `src/`. Keep `main.ts` small and focused on plugin lifecycle (loading, unloading, registering commands).
- **Example file structure**:
  ```
  src/
    main.ts              # Plugin entry point, lifecycle management
    settings.ts          # Settings interface and defaults
    amap-view.ts         # Main map view component
    amap-loader.ts       # AMap API loader
    map/                 # Map-related modules
      types.ts           # TypeScript type definitions
      constants.ts       # Default values
      utils.ts           # Coordinate utilities including WGS-84 to GCJ-02 conversion
      markers.ts         # AMap.Marker management
      popup.ts           # AMap.InfoWindow management
      controls/          # Custom controls (if needed)
  ```
- **Do not commit build artifacts**: Never commit `node_modules/`, `main.js`, or other generated files to version control.
- Keep the plugin small. Avoid large dependencies. Prefer browser-compatible packages.

## AMap API Requirements

This plugin requires an AMap (Gaode Maps) API Key and Security Config.

### Getting an AMap API Key

1. Visit [AMap Developer Console](https://lbs.amap.com/dev/key)
2. Register or log in to your account
3. Create a new application with "Web Platform (JS API)"
4. Get your Key and Security Config (安全密钥)
5. Enter them in the plugin settings

**Important**: Both API Key and Security Config are required for the plugin to work (keys created after Dec 2, 2021).

## Coordinate System

This plugin uses the **GCJ-02 coordinate system** (also known as "Mars Coordinates"), which is the format used by AMap (Gaode Maps).

Coordinate format: `[longitude, latitude]` (e.g., `[116.4074, 39.9042]` for Beijing)

Users should provide coordinates in GCJ-02 format directly. You can get GCJ-02 coordinates from:
- AMap coordinate picker: https://lbs.amap.com/tools/picker
- Other Chinese map services that provide GCJ-02 coordinates

## Map Types

The plugin supports three map types via AMap:

- **Standard (标准地图)**: Default street map
- **Satellite (卫星地图)**: Satellite imagery
- **Hybrid (混合地图)**: Satellite imagery with road labels

## Linting

- To use eslint install eslint from terminal: `npm install -g eslint`
- To use eslint to analyze this project use this command: `eslint main.ts`
- eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder: `eslint ./src/`

## Manifest Rules (`manifest.json`)

- Must include (non-exhaustive):  
  - `id` (plugin ID; for local dev it should match the folder name)  
  - `name`  
  - `version` (Semantic Versioning `x.y.z`)  
  - `minAppVersion`  
  - `description`  
  - `isDesktopOnly` (boolean)  
  - Optional: `author`, `authorUrl`, `fundingUrl` (string or map)
- Never change `id` after release. Treat it as stable API.
- Keep `minAppVersion` accurate when using newer APIs.
- Canonical requirements are coded here: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml

## Testing

- Manual install for testing: copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` (if any) to:
  ```
  <Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-amaps/
  ```
- Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**.
- Generate test data: `python tests/generate_test_files.py 50`

## Commands & Settings

- Any user-facing commands should be added via `this.addCommand(...)`.
- If the plugin has configuration, provide a settings tab and sensible defaults.
- Persist settings using `this.loadData()` / `this.saveData()`.
- Use stable command IDs; avoid renaming once released.

## Versioning & Releases

- Bump `version` in `manifest.json` (SemVer) and update `versions.json` to map plugin version → minimum app version.
- Create a GitHub release whose tag exactly matches `manifest.json`'s `version`. Do not use a leading `v`.
- Attach `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` (if present) to the release as individual assets.
- After the initial release, follow the process to add/update your plugin in the community catalog as required.

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

Follow Obsidian's **Developer Policies** and **Plugin Guidelines**. In particular:

- Default to local/offline operation. Only make network requests when essential to the feature.
- No hidden telemetry. If you collect optional analytics or call third-party services, require explicit opt-in and document clearly in `README.md` and in settings.
- Never execute remote code, fetch and eval scripts, or auto-update plugin code outside of normal releases.
- Minimize scope: read/write only what's necessary inside the vault. Do not access files outside the vault.
- Clearly disclose any external services used, data sent, and risks.
- Respect user privacy. Do not collect vault contents, filenames, or personal information unless absolutely necessary and explicitly consented.
- Avoid deceptive patterns, ads, or spammy notifications.
- Register and clean up all DOM, app, and interval listeners using the provided `register*` helpers so the plugin unloads safely.

## UX & Copy Guidelines (for UI text, commands, settings)

- Prefer sentence case for headings, buttons, and titles.
- Use clear, action-oriented imperatives in step-by-step copy.
- Use **bold** to indicate literal UI labels. Prefer "select" for interactions.
- Use arrow notation for navigation: **Settings → Community plugins**.
- Keep in-app strings short, consistent, and free of jargon.

## Performance

- Keep startup light. Defer heavy work until needed.
- Avoid long-running tasks during `onload`; use lazy initialization.
- Batch disk access and avoid excessive vault scans.
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations in response to file system events.

## Coding Conventions

- TypeScript with `"strict": true` preferred.
- **Keep `main.ts` minimal**: Focus only on plugin lifecycle (onload, onunload, addCommand calls). Delegate all feature logic to separate modules.
- **Split large files**: If any file exceeds ~200-300 lines, consider breaking it into smaller, focused modules.
- **Use clear module boundaries**: Each file should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Bundle everything into `main.js` (no unbundled runtime deps).
- Avoid Node/Electron APIs if you want mobile compatibility; set `isDesktopOnly` accordingly.
- Prefer `async/await` over promise chains; handle errors gracefully.

## Mobile

- Where feasible, test on iOS and Android.
- Don't assume desktop-only behavior unless `isDesktopOnly` is `true`.
- Avoid large in-memory structures; be mindful of memory and storage constraints.

## Agent Do/Don't

**Do**
- Add commands with stable IDs (don't rename once released).
- Provide defaults and validation in settings.
- Write idempotent code paths so reload/unload doesn't leak listeners or intervals.
- Use `this.register*` helpers for everything that needs cleanup.
- Handle AMap API errors gracefully and show user-friendly messages.
- Use GCJ-02 coordinate format `[longitude, latitude]` throughout the plugin.

**Don't**
- Introduce network calls without an obvious user-facing reason and documentation.
- Ship features that require cloud services without clear disclosure and explicit opt-in.
- Store or transmit vault contents unless essential and consented.
- Hardcode API keys or credentials.

## Common Tasks

### Organize code across multiple files

**main.ts** (minimal, lifecycle only):
```ts
import { Plugin } from "obsidian";
import { MySettings, DEFAULT_SETTINGS } from "./settings";
import { registerCommands } from "./commands";

export default class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  settings: MySettings;

  async onload() {
    this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
    registerCommands(this);
  }
}
```

**settings.ts**:
```ts
export interface MySettings {
  apiKey: string;
  securityJsCode: string;
}

export const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = {
  apiKey: "",
  securityJsCode: "",
};
```

### Add a command

```ts
this.addCommand({
  id: "your-command-id",
  name: "Do the thing",
  callback: () => this.doTheThing(),
});
```

### Persist settings

```ts
interface MySettings { apiKey: string }
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = { apiKey: "" };

async onload() {
  this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
  await this.saveData(this.settings);
}
```

### Register listeners safely

```ts
this.registerEvent(this.app.workspace.on("file-open", f => { /* ... */ }));
this.registerDomEvent(window, "resize", () => { /* ... */ });
this.registerInterval(window.setInterval(() => { /* ... */ }, 1000));
```

## Troubleshooting

- Plugin doesn't load after build: ensure `main.js` and `manifest.json` are at the top level of the plugin folder under `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-amaps/`.
- Build issues: if `main.js` is missing, run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` to compile your TypeScript source code.
- Commands not appearing: verify `addCommand` runs after `onload` and IDs are unique.
- Settings not persisting: ensure `loadData`/`saveData` are awaited and you re-render the UI after changes.
- Mobile-only issues: confirm you're not using desktop-only APIs; check `isDesktopOnly` and adjust.
- AMap not loading: verify API Key and Security Config are correct in settings.
- Coordinates showing wrong location: ensure you're using GCJ-02 format `[longitude, latitude]`.
- Markers not showing: check that the coordinates property is correctly set and the Base filter includes the notes.
